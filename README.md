# Appraisal Questions for LCMS Congregations

This is an electronic version of the *"Appraisal Questions for Congregations"* distributed by the LCMS Office of National Mission. The mapping from answers to "focus areas" is done automatically.

To use this program, access [silasec.github.io](https://silasec.github.io) via a web browser, fill the form as directed, and press **Submit** at the bottom of the page. After submission, the tallies for the four focus areas will be printed, along with the IDs of any unanswered questions.

> **Note:** The auto-mapping accounts for the answering directions in the quiz. For example, if question **2-1** is not answered with "**A.**", no answer given for question **2-2** will affect the focus area tallies.
